## Features

- Create, edit, and remove verified cryptocurrency addresses
- Check in realtime if cryptocurrency addresses you inputted on the current tab are verified (a toast will display if the address is)
- Verify button in the chrome extension popup that allows you to double check the cryptocurrency address you inputted on the current tab is verified
